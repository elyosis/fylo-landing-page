## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

As this was a rather simple project, I decided to "go back to the basics" and use only pure HTML and CSS. In hindsight I can see I vastly underestimated the amount of CSS I'd end up writing, so I regret not implementing any kind of modularity. It was also my first time trying to use the BEM methodology to name CSS classes, and while I still doubt some of my choices and the final result ended up being messier than expected, the method was helpful during the entire process.

### What I learned

I wasn't very knowledgeable about how to deal with SVGs, so this project was helpful in that regard. While I found a way to place them correctly, for some reason I was unable to change their fill color through CSS. While trying to find a solution to this, I also learned how to use CSS filters for this purpose, which is how I ultimately solved the issue.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue trying out the BEM naming convention in future projects, as I found it useful and it eases potential specificity issues. I had some issues with the creation of even-sized columns through flexbox for the desktop version of the site, so while I stuck with flexbox on this project I'll probably use Grid instead on future occasions.

### Useful resources

- [Hex color to CSS filter converter](https://isotropic.co/tool/hex-color-to-css-filter/) - I found this while researching on how to get specific hues using CSS filters and it was incredibly useful. Definitely can see myself using it on future projects.
- [Equal Columns With Flexbox: Itâ€™s More Complicated Than You Might Think](https://css-tricks.com/equal-columns-with-flexbox-its-more-complicated-than-you-might-think/) - Highly recommended article on how exactly Flexbox calculates widths for flex items, and how is it that despite our best efforts we can end up getting columns that aren't *really* equal.
